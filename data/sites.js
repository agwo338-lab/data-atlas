// Site Atlas — data file
//
// This is the only file you should need to edit to keep your map up to date.
// Each entry is one facility. Fields:
//   id           unique short slug, no spaces (used internally, never shown)
//   provider     company/operator name — new names are picked up automatically,
//                no other file needs to change when you add a new one
//   site         the facility's own name/label, if it has one (else leave "")
//   city, country
//   lat, lon     decimal degrees
//   status       "Operational" | "Under construction" | "Planned"
//   capacityMW   disclosed power capacity in megawatts, or null if not public
//   lastUpdated  "YYYY-MM-DD" — the last time you checked this entry was still accurate
//   sources      array of { label, url } — every claim above should trace to one of these
//   notes        your own free-text notes — anything you want to remember
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// SOURCING STANDARDS — the checklist to follow every time a site is added
// or re-verified. Keeping this next to the data (not in a separate doc)
// means it's the first thing either of us sees when editing an entry.
//
// 1. Prefer sources in this order, and note which tier you used:
//      Tier 1 — primary: the operator's own newsroom, press release,
//               regulatory filing, or investor disclosure.
//      Tier 2 — named trade press with a byline and date (e.g. Data Center
//               Dynamics, Data Center Frontier) — the industry-standard beat.
//      Tier 3 — directories/aggregators (e.g. Baxtel, datacenters.com) —
//               fine for basic facts (a site exists, its city) but should
//               not be the *only* source for a specific hard number.
//      Avoid  — unattributed blogs, forums, social posts, anything without
//               a clear author, publication, and date.
// 2. Every entry needs at least one source. Any disclosed hard number
//    (MW, $ investment, a date) should trace to Tier 1 or Tier 2 — use two
//    independent sources if the number is large or newsworthy.
// 3. Set lastUpdated to the day you actually verified the fact, not just
//    when you typed the entry.
// 4. "Planned" and "Under construction" entries change fastest — re-check
//    those roughly every 6 months, or sooner if you see it referenced
//    elsewhere with different numbers.
// 5. If a claim can't be sourced, leave the field null/empty rather than
//    guessing — "Not disclosed" is honest, a fabricated number isn't.

Phase 1 is under construction targeting full operation in 2026; Phase 2 (~600,000 sq ft addition) was approved by the Vineland Planning Board on Aug 18, 2026. Some secondary press floats a further expansion toward 350MW — not yet confirmed by a primary Nebius source, so not used here.
